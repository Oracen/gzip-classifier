To extend that for another 14 days there has to be a court hearing.” On Jan. 3, when Ms. Spears refused to return her children to her ex-husband, Kevin Federline, who has custody, the police had paramedics take her from her home to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was released after a day and a half.	5	2008-02-01 07:49:27	\N

Medical Center, right, early on Thursday, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Spears, 26, whose erratic behavior has made her a public spectacle and cost her the custody of her two young sons, was hospitalized to “get help,” said a Los Angeles police officer who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. Allan Parachini, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Superior Court, said: “The way it works is a law enforcement agency or mental health professional can conclude that someone is a danger to self or others and undertake an involuntary commitment. To extend that for another 14 days there has to be a court hearing.” On Jan. 3, when Ms. Spears refused to return her children to her ex-husband, Kevin Federline, who has custody, the police had paramedics take her from her home to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was released after a day and a half.	5	2008-02-01 08:54:37	\N

"For us, it's one of the largest deals that we've done in [the] Europe, Middle East, Africa region as a company," Douglas said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">The entire deal is part of a Russian federal initiative called the National State Project of High-Grade Education. The total value of the deal is worth $100 million, but CodeGear would not say what its share of that pie will be.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Both Delphi and Delphi for .Net will be provided along with C++Builder. The total number of licenses distributed for the three products will reach 1 million.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Delphi is focused on native, compiled Windows application development on the desktop. Asked if the deal represents a revival for Delphi, which had been a Borland Software product, Douglas acknowledged that this might be the perception. "From our perspective, [Delphi has] never been diminished," he said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">While Microsoft is pushing enterprise-level application development, sectors like engineering and science seek native, compiled applications, Douglas said. "This [deal] is just a continued indicator of Delphi in that segment," he said. CodeGear with the deal is focusing on client-server desktop applications.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">CodeGear, Douglas said, does not compete much with Microsoft's Visual Studio platform anymore. Microsoft's focus is on .Net and managed code, while CodeGear is centered on the native compiled space, although it does have .Net capabilities.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">CodeGear's offering in the managed code space is its JBuilder product for Java application development in the enterprise, Douglas said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">CodeGear, meanwhile, is making product plans for the year that include adding Unicode capabilities for internationalization to Delphi and C++Builder. This will be included in the 2008 versions of the products due out in the first half of this year.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Also planned are language enhancements for Delphi and a second release of CodeGear's Delphi for PHP, which will identified as version 1.1 and be more robust, Douglas said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">CodeGear was spun out of Borland about a year ago to focus on development tools. But CodeGear still is owned by Borland, which now concentrates on the application lifecycle management space. Plans still call for CodeGear to become a separate, independent company.</p></div>	4	2008-02-01 12:20:20	\N

The chips hit a high of $18.50 on Aug. 14. The price of 4Gb MLC (multi-level cell) NAND flash chips have taken a slightly worse dive, 75 percent down to $2.23 on Thursday, compared to its summer high of $8.85 per chip.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">The difference between SLC and MLC is cost and life span. SLC normally costs about three times more than MLC, and has a lifetime of 100,000 write cycles. MLC has a lifetime of only 10,000 write cycles.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Toshiba and Samsung have both developed new 128GB SSDs based in MLC NAND to expand their use in notebook PCs. The new SSDs are less expensive, giving notebook PC designers more choices in storage.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;At 128G bytes, you&#39;re giving consumers the kind of storage space they expect in a notebook,&quot; said Jim Elliott, director of flash marketing at Samsung, in an interview.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">To work around the lifespan issue, Toshiba and Samsung use controller chips to spread writes across the drive to avoid wearing out any one portion too quickly.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">The new MLC-based drives are an important step forward for SSDs in the battle against hard disk drives (HDD). At 128GB, an SSD stands are far better chance of replacing an HDD in laptop computers because it removes some of the high-capacity advantage HDDs hold.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">SSDs have several advantages over HDDs; they&#39;re lighter, more rugged, consume less power, make no noise and enable a computer to start up and load software faster than HDDs. But SSDs are a lot more expensive than HDDs, which is why they&#39;re mainly used in the business laptop market, where users are willing to pay more for performance and reliability.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Elliott believes SSDs for PCs will account for 27 percent of NAND consumption by 2011, particularly in business laptops and mobile devices.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">SanDisk has taken a slightly different route in SSDs than Toshiba and Samsung. The company made a 72GB SSD in a thinner form factor aimed at mobile devices. The drive takes up less space, so it could be used in a range of mobile devices, said Iri Trashanski, director of strategic business development at SanDisk.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">He doesn&#39;t believe there will be a market for 128GB SSDs for a while.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Brian Kumagi, senior business development manager NAND flash memory business at Toshiba, believes the lower cost of MLC NAND chips will play a major role in seeing 128GB SSDs gain market share.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Toshiba is also offering MLC NAND SSDs in 32GB and 64GB capacities to entice laptop PC makers and makers of digital music players and other devices requiring more storage.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">There are several other products where companies are adding NAND flash to increase storage capacity and improve devices. One, thanks to the iPhone, is handsets, said Elliott.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Multimedia handsets will likely see 8GB of embedded flash memory become the standard this year, and card slots are being added to a host of mobile phones to increase storage and for added content delivery, including movies, games, software and more.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Plus, low prices are encouraging new innovation, just as low NAND prices helped put the chips into more iPods earlier this decade. One area is in video cameras, namely, <a href="http://www.theflip.com/">Flip</a> video and similar devices.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">For $119.99, users can buy a Flip video camcorder that uses NAND flash memory to store 30 minutes of recordings.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">In addition, devices such as GPS (global positioning system) for cars will need more flash when 3D (three dimensional) digital maps start replacing 2D maps.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">The good news for users is that there are so many NAND flash memory makers in the world today that prices will remain low or at least reasonable for a long time.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">In a report titled &quot;Flash to crash,&quot; Macquarie Securities chip analyst Warren Lau wrote that NAND flash memory prices will likely remain low throughout the first half of this year, with little room for upside until the third quarter.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">&quot;We continue to warn that NAND flash will see excess supply in the first half of 2008 owing to aggressive production ramp (at IM Flash and Toshiba) and the seasonally weaker period for consumer products (digital still cameras, handsets and MP3),&quot; he wrote.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Much of the possible price movements in NAND flash actually depend on Apple because of the widespread popularity of the iPod and iPhone.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">The company announced it has already shipped over 4 million iPhones and continues to ramp shipments. iPod shipment growth has dropped a bit, according to market researcher Gartner, but higher capacity iPod products such as the Touch have done well in the market.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">&quot;Apple is a critical driver of NAND flash consumption and will continue to yield great influence on NAND flash vendors,&quot; Gartner said in a report on Monday.</p></div>	4	2008-02-01 13:27:33	\N

Micron was one of the founders of the ONFI Working Group in 2006, and other member companies include Hynix Semiconductor, Intel, Phison Electronics, Sony and STMicroelectronics.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Micron is now sampling the high-speed NAND component, with mass production expected to commence in the second half of 2008, the company said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Products based on the ONFI 2.0 specification have been under development and were expected, said Joseph Unsworth, a principal analyst at Gartner.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;It wasn&#39;t anything that wasn&#39;t expected.

However, it will be priced at a premium and only multimedia enthusiasts looking for high-performance flash memory would be willing buyers, Unsworth said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">As prices stabilize, it will reach mainstream devices like MP3 players and digital cameras, but that could be a long time away, he said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">The new flash technology from Micron and Intel could also face competition from Samsung and Toshiba, the world&#39;s top flash vendors, who combined represent 60 percent of products supplied in the NAND flash market. The two companies last year signed an agreement to share specifications to develop faster and more robust NAND interfaces, Unsworth said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">While both factions will ultimately deliver high-performance flash technology to consumers, they need to unite under one banner to ease the development of high-speed flash technology.

InfoWorld news	http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/01/Microsoft-offer-to-Yahoo-board_1.html	Microsoft's offer to Yahoo's board	none	Sci/Tech	<div class="rxbodyfield"><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">In a letter to Yahoo&#39;s board, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer&#160;<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/01/Microsoft-offers-to-buy-Yahoo-for-44-billion_1.html">offered to acquire the company</a>&#160;for a per-share price of $31 in cash or 0.9509 of a share of Microsoft common stock -- a 62 percent premium above the Jan. 31, closing price of Yahoo -- and cited the broad range of ways in which the companies might work together to create a more effective competitor in the online marketplace. Below is the text of the letter that Microsoft sent to Yahoo&#39;s Board of Directors:</p><p align="right"><a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /><img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/></a></p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">January 31, 2008</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Board of Directors</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Yahoo! Inc.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">701 First Avenue</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Sunnyvale, CA 94089</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Attention: Roy Bostock, Chairman</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Attention: Jerry Yang, Chief Executive Officer</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Dear Members of the Board:</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">I am writing on behalf of the Board of Directors of Microsoft to make a proposal for a business combination of Microsoft and Yahoo!. Under our proposal, Microsoft would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Yahoo! common stock for per share consideration of $31 based on Microsoft&#39;s closing share price on January 31, 2008, payable in the form of $31 in cash or 0.9509 of a share of Microsoft common stock. Microsoft would provide each Yahoo! shareholder with the ability to choose whether to receive the consideration in cash or Microsoft common stock, subject to pro-ration so that in the aggregate one-half of the Yahoo! common shares will be exchanged for shares of Microsoft common stock and one-half of the Yahoo! common shares will be converted into the right to receive cash. Our proposal is not subject to any financing condition.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Our proposal represents a 62% premium above the closing price of Yahoo! common stock of $19.18 on January 31, 2008. The implied premium for the operating assets of the company clearly is considerably greater when adjusted for the minority, non-controlled assets and cash. By whatever financial measure you use - EBITDA, free cash flow, operating cash flow, net income, or analyst target prices - this proposal represents a compelling value realization event for your shareholders.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">We believe that Microsoft common stock represents a very attractive investment opportunity for Yahoo!&#39;s shareholders. Microsoft has generated revenue growth of 15%, earnings growth of 26%, and a return on equity of 35% on average for the last three years. Microsoft&#39;s share price has generated shareholder returns of 8% during the last one year period and 28% during the last three year period, significantly outperforming the S&amp;P 500. It is our view that Microsoft has significant potential upside given the continued solid growth in our core businesses, the recent launch of Windows Vista, and other strategic initiatives.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Microsoft&#39;s consistent belief has been that the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo! clearly represents the best way to deliver maximum value to our respective shareholders, as well as create a more efficient and competitive company that would provide greater value and service to our customers. In late 2006 and early 2007, we jointly explored a broad range of ways in which our two companies might work together. These discussions were based on a vision that the online businesses of Microsoft and Yahoo! should be aligned in some way to create a more effective competitor in the online marketplace. We discussed a number of alternatives ranging from commercial partnerships to a merger proposal, which you rejected. While a commercial partnership may have made sense at one time, Microsoft believes that the only alternative now is the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo! that we are proposing.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">In February 2007, I received a letter from your Chairman indicating the view of the Yahoo! Board that &quot;now is not the right time from the perspective of our shareholders to enter into discussions regarding an acquisition transaction.&quot; According to that letter, the principal reason for this view was the Yahoo! Board&#39;s confidence in the &quot;potential upside&quot; if management successfully executed on a reformulated strategy based on certain operational initiatives, such as Project Panama, and a significant organizational realignment. A year has gone by, and the competitive situation has not improved.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">While online advertising growth continues, there are significant benefits of scale in advertising platform economics, in capital costs for search index build-out, and in research and development, making this a time of industry consolidation and convergence. Today, the market is increasingly dominated by one player who is consolidating its dominance through acquisition. Together, Microsoft and Yahoo! can offer a credible alternative for consumers, advertisers, and publishers. Synergies of this combination fall into four areas:</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Scale economics: This combination enables synergies related to scale economics of the advertising platform where today there is only one competitor at scale. This includes synergies across both search and non-search related advertising that will strengthen the value proposition to both advertisers and publishers. Additionally, the combination allows us to consolidate capital spending.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Expanded R&amp;D capacity: The combined talent of our engineering resources can be focused on R&amp;D priorities such as a single search index and single advertising platform. Together we can unleash new levels of innovation, delivering enhanced user experiences, breakthroughs in search, and new advertising platform capabilities. Many of these breakthroughs are a function of an engineering scale that today neither of our companies has on its own.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Operational efficiencies: Eliminating redundant infrastructure and duplicative operating costs will improve the financial performance of the combined entity.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Emerging user experiences: Our combined ability to focus engineering resources that drive innovation in emerging scenarios such as video, mobile services, online commerce, social media, and social platforms is greatly enhanced.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">We would value the opportunity to further discuss with you how to optimize the integration of our respective businesses to create a leading global technology company with exceptional display and search advertising capabilities. You should also be aware that we intend to offer significant retention packages to your engineers, key leaders and employees across all disciplines.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">We have dedicated considerable time and resources to an analysis of a potential transaction and are confident that the combination will receive all necessary regulatory approvals. We look forward to discussing this with you, and both our internal legal team and outside counsel are available to meet with your counsel at their earliest convenience.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Our proposal is subject to the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement and our having the opportunity to conduct certain limited and confirmatory due diligence. In addition, because a portion of the aggregate merger consideration would consist of Microsoft common stock, we would provide Yahoo! the opportunity to conduct appropriate limited due diligence with respect to Microsoft. We are prepared to deliver a draft merger agreement to you and begin discussions immediately.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">In light of the significance of this proposal to your shareholders and ours, as well as the potential for selective disclosures, our intention is to publicly release the text of this letter tomorrow morning.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Due to the importance of these discussions and the value represented by our proposal, we expect the Yahoo! Board to engage in a full review of our proposal. My leadership team and I would be happy to make ourselves available to meet with you and your Board at your earliest convenience. Depending on the nature of your response, Microsoft reserves the right to pursue all necessary steps to ensure that Yahoo!&#39;s shareholders are provided with the opportunity to realize the value inherent in our proposal.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">We believe this proposal represents a unique opportunity to create significant value for Yahoo!&#39;s shareholders and employees, and the combined company will be better positioned to provide an enhanced value proposition to users and advertisers. We hope that you and your Board share our enthusiasm, and we look forward to a prompt and favorable reply.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Sincerely yours,</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">/s/ Steven A. Ballmer</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Steven A.

According to him, "if you expect the above code to produce the same values, you are sadly mistaken". His example gives an interesting result for the first echo statement - not echoing the 9 in the first character like it seems would make sense.

In <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/opal/2008/01/31#a268">this new post</a> to his Oracle blog, <i>Christopher Jones</i> mentions some updates he's made to the OCI8 extension for PHP:\
</p>\
<blockquote>\
I've merged connection pooling (DRCP) and Fast Application Notification (FAN) support to PHP 5.3's OCI8 extension.  The PHP 5.3 OCI8 code is Beta - in fact, PHP 5.3 itself is still really "Development". (It would be handy to have problems reported before PHP 5.3 goes Production).\
</blockquote>\
<p>\
He also includes <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/opal/2008/01/31#a268">instructions</a> on how to get this new version installed inside of the latest PHP 5.3 snapshot (<a href="http://snaps.php.net">http://snaps.php.net</a>) to build the new support in.\

Immediately, the executive directors of the Center for Digital Democracy (CDD) and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) said the acquisition would raise serious privacy concerns.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">CDD will press the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and Congress to &quot;scrutinize this deal and impose the needed safeguards for it -- and the industry,&quot; said Jeffrey Chester, CDD&#39;s executive director. CDD and EPIC tried to stop Google&#39;s proposed acquisition of online ad service DoubleClick on privacy grounds before the FTC last year, but the FTC approved the deal in December.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">The Microsoft-Yahoo deal, if consummated, would &quot;create a powerful interactive Internet duopoly in online media,&quot; Chester said. &quot;Google and Microsoft will have inordinate power to shape the online communications marketplace, including journalism, entertainment and advertising. There are consequences to democratic societies everywhere, as two digital gatekeepers are likely to control how the Internet and other interactive media evolve.&quot;</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">The proposed deal also underscores a need for new laws or regulations that protect consumer data, Chester added. &quot;In an era when individuals are increasingly conducting their personal, social and political lives online, the corporations that control the digital experience will have a far-reaching influence over every aspect of society,&quot; he said. &quot;Consumers will be more vulnerable to having their personal information become the property of the GoogleClick&#39;s and Microhoo&#39;s.&quot;</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">But the DOJ and FTC may have little grounds to oppose a Microsoft/Yahoo merger, said Professor Keith Hylton, who specializes in antitrust issues at the Boston University law school. While Microsoft and Yahoo compete in some areas, Microsoft could argue this a &quot;vertical&quot; merger that largely expands its online services, but largely doesn&#39;t eliminate competition, he said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;I think Microsoft is trying to ramp up in the online services/online ad revenue business,&quot; Hylton said. &quot;Microsoft is a small player in that area, and Google is a big player. This is a merger of two firms trying to compete against a big monster out there -- Google.&quot;</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">But the deal could face more hurdles in Europe. If the deal allows Microsoft to take components of Windows online, and &quot;in the process increases Microsoft&#39;s dominance of the market for PC operating systems,&quot; then the European Commission would have to prohibit the deal, said an antitrust lawyer in Europe who asked not to be identified.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">European Union merger rules prohibit dominant companies from increasing their dominance, the lawyer said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">The combined company would likely have sell off an instant-messaging service, added a European Commission official familiar with the competition department. &quot;I can&#39;t see how Microsoft/Yahoo would be allowed to keep both instant-messaging services,&quot; said the official, who also asked not to be identified.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Microsoft campaigned for federal regulators to block the Google-DoubleClick deal, partly on antitrust grounds. But Google argued the acquisition would join two companies operating in different online markets.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">This week, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia extended antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft for two years. But the U.S. government&#39;s antitrust case against Microsoft was based on its desktop and server operating systems, not online services. If anything, the old antitrust case could help Microsoft make the case for approval of its acquisition of Yahoo, Hylton said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;I assume Microsoft people can say, &#39;Look, we&#39;re already under a microscope, doesn&#39;t this suggest we&#39;re less likely to do anticompetitive things?&#39;&quot; Hylton said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">But a consolidating online market means users will have their data held by a small number of companies, said Professor Joseph Turow, at University of Pennsylvania school of communication.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;Microsoft&#39;s decision to buy Yahoo is a direct result of the decision by the FTC to allow Google to purchase DoubleClick,&quot; he said. &quot;It is further evidence that despite the appearance of unlimited choice in the new media environment, people&#39;s activities will be tracked and shaped by a very small number of companies who care far more about surveillance and targeted advertising than the public interest.&quot;</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">The public needs to demand privacy scrutiny in the proposed deal, he said. &quot;The federal government, which should have been the guardian of the public interest, has dropped the ball.&quot;</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody"><em>(Additional reporting by Paul Meller in Brussels.)</em></p></div>	4	2008-02-01 19:44:59	\N

A little while back <i>Matthew Turland</i> <a href="http://ishouldbecoding.com/2008/01/19/the-yin-and-yang-of-typing/">posted about</a> something that some developers moving over to PHP from more strict languages have an issue with - variable typing - and how its evolved in languages over time.\
</p>\
<blockquote>\
Without a little background in programming languages or computer science in general, it's entirely possible that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">typing systems</a> are not something that have crossed your mind. I thought I'd take a blog entry to share some of my thoughts on how itâs affecting the creation and evolution of languages.\
</blockquote>\
<p>\
He walks through history a bit, mentioning C, Java, Python and PHP and how they differ in their default type handling. He especially focuses on the "blurred line" between strong and weak typing and how some if offers special features to the language that uses the method.\

Sure. What else do they have to do?<br><br>\
Most tech companies are pretty aimless, people think there's a grand plan to Apple or Google, but I bet there isn't. They just throw stuff up on the wall, if it sticks, do version 2.0. <img src="http://www.scripting.com/gifs/QBullets/qbullets/sidesmiley.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="smile"><br><br>\
Does Yahoo + Microsoft make sense?<br><br>\
Nahh. It's like the dead leading the blind.<br><br>\
The only reason the deal makes sense is because it's the only thing either company could do that anyone might possibly <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080201/p26#a080201p26">care</a> about.<br><br>\
It would make more sense for Twitter to acquire Yahoo. At least then they'd get some servers that could stay up for 24 hours straight. <img src="http://www.scripting.com/gifs/QBullets/qbullets/sidesmiley.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="smile"><br><br>\
Anyway, I might have been too hard on em. But then again...<br><br>\

Penny Arcade	http://feeds.penny-arcade.com/~r/pa-mainsite/~3/227404279/	News: Rez is amazing	none	Toons	Gabe: I just have some random stuff to share here.Pokemon League night is next Tuesday at the Comic Stop. Matches start at six pm, but you can show up a little early if you'd like to trade cards. As always new players are welcome, just bring a starter deck. It's also a good idea to register at Go-Pokemon.com and bring your POP ID. A reader wrote in today to tell me that he was doing the New York Times crossword puzzle for January 30th and noticed this clue for 12 down:  "Tycho's pal in the webcomic 'Penny Arcade' (4 letters)." That's totally awesome. I'm sure the Force Unleashed will be fine. The time period around the original trilogy is just getting so crowded. Now Vader has a secret apprentice? I mean, it makes sense canonically to me. The Emperor had Mara Jade out there doing his dirty work. It's not unreasonable to think Vader had a similar arrangement. Also the very nature of Sith rule makes covering your ass a necessity. The hook for the game is fine and I don't mind the 3rd person action stuff. There are a few games I'd much rather see them make though. The fact that they have not made a sequel to Republic Commando is fucking criminal. That's not a joke either. I mean that someone over there should be put in jail for the rest of their life. RepCom was an incredible squad based shooter, and unlike most games in that genre it was packed with awesome characters. This games deserves a next gen sequel. The other game that needs a next gen installment is Tie Fighter. Seriously that game came out in 1994 and it's one of the best space shooters ever. And for fucks sake stop setting things during the movies. There's nearly sixty years worth of incredible content (minus the dark nest series) extending out past Return of the Jedi. You don't have to keep trying to cram stories into the same 20 year period. They're milking so much content out of that period that eventually we'll be playing a game as Luke where the goal is to repair vaporators on the south ridge. Hurry up you've only got 'till mid day!Rez is available on Xbox Live now. It's one of the best games ever made.   The most popular piece of clothing we've ever made, AKA The Black Mantle is back in stock. It's joined by its polar opposite, the Luminous Vestments. I have a feeling both will be sold out before I finish typing this.   -Gabe out<img src="http://feeds.penny-arcade.com/~r/pa-mainsite/~4/227404279" height="1" width="1"/>	5	2008-02-01 22:47:05	\N

<i>Frank Kleine</i> has <a href="http://www.stubbles.org/archives/41-Stubbles-0.5.0-released.html">announced on the Stubbles blog</a> that the latest version of the framework, Stubbles 0.5.0 has been released.\
</p>\
<blockquote>\
A last day of a month - time to release a new Stubbles version. The release does not feature that much new features, we focused mainly on infrastructure and code quality improvements. The most important change of course is the change of the package separator.\
</blockquote>\
<p>\
Instead of the dots they've gone with the more standard double-colon that PHP already uses. There were also code quality improvements and a move away from SimpleTest out to the popular <a href="http://www.phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a> unit testing package.\
</p>\
<p>\
You can download this new package from the <a href="http://www.stubbles.net/">Stubbles project site</a>.\

If Microsoft is willing to spend that much money, it also has to be willing to change some old ways of thinking to make the most out of the investment, analysts say.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">To achieve this, analysts caution Microsoft to be careful not to view Yahoo as a one-trick pony, taken onboard only for its user base and infrastructure to bolster Microsoft&#39;s online advertising interests against Google. While this is certainly the primary reason for the deal, to make the most of it, Microsoft has to not only respect the strength of Yahoo&#39;s brand but also be willing to let go of some of its own traditional proprietary interests -- not just on the product side but in its culture as well.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Microsoft has never been one to let go of its vision or proprietary interests too easily; when acquiring companies, it usually subsumes the products and services and brands them as its own.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">While this has worked in the past because Microsoft traditionally has shied away from acquiring big-name or big-ticket items --&#160;<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/05/18/microsoft-to-buy-aquantive_1.html">last year&#39;s $6 billion aQuantive deal</a>&#160;was a notable exception -- it&#39;s not as simple to do this with a company like Yahoo, analysts said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">In the areas of online search and particular services and as an online destination for users, Yahoo is a stronger brand than Microsoft. Microsoft must recognize this and be willing to give up some of its interest in new content and services branded, respectively, under MSN and Windows Live to make the deal successful, said Ned May, director and lead analyst for market research firm Outsell.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;The big question is, will Microsoft take this and recognize it for being a stronger property and migrate its efforts there, or will it try to push its own efforts out through Yahoo?&quot; he asked. &quot;Historically, there&#39;s no precedent for it to do anything but use [an acquired company] to get Microsoft&#39;s message out.&quot;</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Though Microsoft and Yahoo are different types of companies and the union itself makes much more sense, Ron Schmelzer, analyst and managing partner with Zapthink, likened the deal to Time Warner-AOL, in which AOL&#39;s brand was damaged, not enhanced, after all was said and done.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">But investing as much as the gross domestic product of some countries in one company could inspire Microsoft to &quot;change its stripes&quot; and rethink its own interests, he said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">To make the deal a true success, Microsoft also has to prove that it can let go of its entrenched Windows OS and desktop software culture, which had been the anchor keeping Microsoft from moving more quickly against Google and Yahoo in online advertising and services in the first place, Schmelzer said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;The application itself is moving away from the thing that sits captive on your desktop to the thing that&#39;s distributed on the Internet,&quot; he said. &quot;Microsoft has to rid itself of its &#39;80s and &#39;90s perspective -- which was great in the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, but now 80 percent of the value of the computer is not in the computer itself.&quot;</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Microsoft had been moving in this direction before Friday&#39;s news, but it has been burdened by its need to keep the customers of two of its biggest consumer products -- Windows and Office -- happy, as well as its enormous portfolio of enterprise and business customers. Instead of moving full bore into the Web, Microsoft had adopted a &quot;software plus services&quot; strategy as a nod to its software legacy and inability to move fully to a more services-oriented strategy because of it.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Still, some think an entire cultural shift isn&#39;t necessary for Microsoft to make the most out of the deal. David Mitchell Smith, vice president and fellow at Gartner, said Microsoft can leverage Yahoo successfully without changing its usual way of doing things, by keeping the brand and merging the best parts of Yahoo&#39;s Internet business, such as its online content, advertising and search, with its online services efforts.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">&quot;I would expect to see the Yahoo brand come out of this very, very strong,&quot; he said. In particular, Microsoft has been making moves to drive more video and other multimedia content online through MSN, and that is one area where the company could give up its own identity in favor of Yahoo&#39;s, Smith said.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Andrew Brust, chief, new technology for consulting firm twentysix New York, said that the combination of Microsoft&#39;s existing Web technology and the Yahoo brand would be &quot;nicely complementary,&quot; though he acknowledged the risks of such a union. Even so, &quot;risk aversion is not a good Internet strategy,&quot; Brust said. Taking a risk in this area as well as bringing &quot;some truly Internet-focused mindset into the corporate culture&quot; may be just what Microsoft needs.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Others likened the deal to another risky one, HP-Compaq, which many feared would be a disaster because of product overlap and cultural differences. That deal eventually proved successful.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">However, it&#39;s important to keep in mind how much more of a role that culture and the cool factor plays on the Internet than it does in the world of traditional computer hardware, warned Outsell&#39;s May. He said Yahoo users may be put off by the notion of Microsoft as their new daddy and see Google as the lesser of two evils, which would defeat the notion of the Microsoft-Yahoo union in the first place.</p></div>	4	2008-02-01 23:45:12	\N

<i>Rob Thompson</i> has <a href="http://rob.sun3.org/php-code/switch-vs-if/">posted about</a> some simple benchmarking he did comparing the speed of a series of "if" statements versus one "switch" with multiple cases.\
</p>\
<blockquote>\
I got curious about which is actually more efficient at matching a random integer with a set of conditionals. So, I setup a script to create a set of large scripts to test the speed of these different constructs. Using the 'time' command, I measured the speed at which the condition could match a random number.\
</blockquote>\
<p>\
His results found that the switch statement is generally more than 2 times as fast at matching a simple integer. His tests, however, didn't go through much more than this simple test. It'd be interesting to see what it would do with something more complex (like longer strings or handling the result of an evaluation inside the definition of the switch().\

With Yahoo&#39;s online services, engineers, and ad platforms, Microsoft hopes to become a stronger competitor to Google than it is today.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">That all sounds fine in theory, but Ballmer and his colleagues said little about the energy and know-how they will need to make this proposed $44.6 billion acquisition work, considering that the companies have a significant overlap in online services, markedly different cultures, and an abundance of inflated professional egos at every level.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Not to mention that Yahoo these days is far from functioning as a well-oiled machine. Yahoo has been in significant turmoil for more than a year. Seasoned executives who are experts on its business have struggled and largely failed to restore the company&#39;s technical edge and business focus. That&#39;s a mess that Microsoft will inherit and will have to solve in order for the deal to work its expected magic.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">In short, Microsoft must make sure that, in its quest for scale and speed, it doesn&#39;t end up getting stuck, its wheels spinning, trying to mesh Yahoo with MSN, while Google speeds further ahead. It&#39;s clear that to take advantage of the online ad growth, companies will need to innovate and change quickly, and not be sidetracked by acquisition distractions.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Among the many emerging opportunities in online advertising are: the mobile sector, which is expected to go from almost nonexistent to vibrant in the coming years; social Web properties, such as social networks, blogs and social news sites, which haven&#39;t been monetized properly and hold great promise; and video, both in the form of video ads and ads in videos.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">There were indications during Friday&#39;s news conference that Microsoft may not have taken the time to fully assess the magnitude of the integration complications. Despite Ballmer&#39;s assurances that he personally has thought &quot;long and hard&quot; about the Yahoo acquisition, there is evidently a level of urgency about the move, or else the deal wouldn&#39;t have been an unsolicited offer, as Yahoo has portrayed it.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">If, as Ballmer indicated, the companies have been in on-and-off talks for about 18 months about a possible acquisition, it&#39;s fair to ask -- as a financial analyst did -- why they couldn&#39;t sit down privately and present, jointly, a more cooked deal. Basically, Ballmer admitted that Google keeps expanding its empire and time is of the essence.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">&quot;Any large integration process has risks associated with it. We&#39;ve all thought about it. We could have hired [more] engineers, but at the same time the market continues to grow and the leader continues to consolidate positions and there&#39;s nothing quite like putting together two larger sophisticated R&amp;D organizations,&quot; Ballmer said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="2">Along with the inherent opportunity to sell more ads, Nick Patience, managing analyst at The 451 Group, also sees a &quot;potential integration headache&quot; with having to integrate Microsoft&#39;s ad platforms -- AdCenter and aQuantive -- with Yahoo&#39;s. Patience is also skeptical about the possibility of merging search indexes, and believes that the search engines will most likely have to continue to operate independently. Overall, the integration work would represent for Microsoft &quot;a step into the unknown,&quot; particularly since this would be by far the largest acquisition in Microsoft&#39;s history, Patience said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="2">Gartner analyst Allen Weiner also sees potential integration challenges, particularly because he doesn&#39;t think either organization has a powerful leader who can take the reins of the combined entity and lead it into the future. &quot;They need someone like a Steve Jobs or a Bill Gates who has the charisma, vision, technical knowledge, and consumer knowledge to lead,&quot; Weiner said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="2">On paper the acquisition has interesting potential, but it will all come down to how the integration is carried out, Weiner said. &quot;It&#39;s all about the execution,&quot; he said. &quot;The devil is in the details.&quot;</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="2">Despite numerous acquisitions over the past few years in advertising and Web 2.0 technologies, Yahoo has struggled to jump-start its business, said JupiterResearch analyst Michael Gartenberg. &quot;At the end of the day, it hasn&#39;t all worked out for them,&quot; he said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="2">While Microsoft executives are stressing that a deal with Yahoo would give it the scale to compete with Google, wrapping the two companies&#39; diverse technologies together won&#39;t be simple, Gartenberg said. &quot;In order to get to that scale, you&#39;ve got to be able to fit all those pieces and parts together,&quot; he said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="2">Despite the integration concerns, Microsoft has good processes in place for managing acquisitions of large companies, said Gartner analyst Mike McGuire. However, it will be key for Microsoft to quickly put a senior management team in place as Google will continue to propel ahead as Microsoft sorts out the details. &quot;They are going to have to start showing some traction, or at least a really solid vision for how they will combine the companies ... early on,&quot; McGuire said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="2">Matt Booth, a Kelsey Group analyst, thinks that the integration challenges will be major but predicts that Microsoft will work through them methodically, starting on the back end and linking services in a way that, as much as possible, is transparent to end-users, be they advertisers, publishers, or consumers. For services that are just too difficult to integrate, they will likely be kept separate. The last thing Microsoft wants to do is drive users away, Booth said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="2">In a research note, Citigroup financial analyst Mark Mahaney said he is skeptical that a combined Microsoft-Yahoo would improve its search products enough to affect Google&#39;s position, since they both have been losing search market share and, in his opinion, seeing a decrease in their search innovation.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="2">&quot;Given what would surely be immense integration challenges, it&#8217;s hard for us to see how a Microsoft-Yahoo combination would create a greater technology competitor to Google at least for the foreseeable future,&quot; he wrote.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="2">&quot;We could see a scenario by which Google would actually gain more market share due to industry uncertainty over the integration of the deal,&quot; Mahaney added.</p></div>	4	2008-02-02 01:10:30	\N

These vendors are committing to use PHP 5.2 in releases developed after Tuesday.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Campaign advocates also have issued an invitation to other PHP projects to participate, and so far, about 150 software projects and about 200 Web hosters have committed.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Most PHP Web applications run in PHP 4 and 5. PHP 4 was released in 2000, while PHP 5 became available in 2004.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">"We think PHP is absolutely the platform going forward," said Mark de Visser, chief marketing officer at PHP tools vendor Zend Technologies, which is supporting the Go PHP5 effort.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">PHP 5 features object orientation, for enterprise application development, and Web services capabilities, de Visser said. But adoption has been slow because of issues like Web hosts that offer PHP 4 by default, Go PHP 5 said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">"No one's moving to PHP 5 because no one wants to be first," said Larry Garfield, a co-founder of the Go PHP 5 project.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Hosts will not upgrade until projects do, but projects will not upgrade until hosts do, thus presenting a chicken-and-egg situation, according to Go PHP 5's July 2007 statement. Go PHP 5 hopes to give Web hosts incentive to upgrade servers to newer versions of PHP.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Additionally, extensions to the PHP 4 platform are ceasing, according to Garfield. There will only be major security issues considered between now and August, and after that, PHP development stops, he said.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">PHP 6, meanwhile, is not due for more than a year, de Visser said. It will focus on internationalization, he said.</p></div>	4	2008-02-02 02:23:48	\N

Wi-Fi Rail hopes to roll out such networks on rail systems around the world and charge commuters for access.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Commuter rail, with thousands of daily riders, could represent a rich opportunity for public wireless Internet access. Wi-Fi hotspots in airports and coffee shops have drawn some paying users, but the hotspots are useful more for occasional than for regular use. And citywide public Wi-Fi networks, often planned out with local governments, have run into political and business problems.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Wi-Fi Rail, founded in 2006 and based near Sacramento, would build two kinds of Wi-Fi networks: one in the cars and one around the tracks, said Michael Cromar, Wi-Fi Rail&#39;s CFO. Passengers would log in to access points on each car, and each car&#39;s network would lock on to one access point after another along the rail system. The trackside access points, in turn, would feed traffic onto fiber-optic lines. Roaming would be handled by the in-car network and be transparent to users, Cromar said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Even better than typical home broadband, the network can deliver its average 15Mbps speed both upstream and downstream, according to Wi-Fi Rail. Passengers would share that link, but in tests, there was no noticeable slowdown between one passenger and eight passengers using the network, Cromar said. The system worked with the trains moving at speeds as high as 65 miles per hour.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">The company tested its technology in both underground and above-ground parts of the BART system. Above ground, Wi-Fi Rail used standard outdoor access points with line-of-sight antennas to form a link from trains as they went by. In an underground test, the company used &quot;leaky&quot; coaxial cable, a technology some rail systems already use for exchanging operational data with cars, according to Cromar. The leaky cable is deliberately unshielded so signals traveling along it can be picked up all through a tunnel.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">In-car tests took place on a 2.6-mile BART test track last month, as well as on a stretch of tunnel in San Francisco. Another part of the test proved such a service can draw customers, Cromar said. Wi-Fi Rail set up regular access points in four underground stations in downtown San Francisco and let people waiting for trains register and use the network for free. Without any publicity, more than 6,400 people signed up in less than six months, he said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Although BART hosted the tests, it hasn&#39;t made a deal to have such a network deployed, Cromar said. But Wi-Fi Rail has talked with one interested transit system in the U.S. and is working with a partner to approach a rail system in another country, he said. The company said its technology is ready to go and could be used for anything that follows a predetermined path, including highways.</p></div>	4	2008-02-02 03:27:27	\N

Its early MSN e-mail and IM offerings are popular enough with Web users; however, users of Google and Yahoo online services have been loath to adopt the revamped Windows Live offerings in favor of the ones they&#39;re already using.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Not only could that change if the company purchases Yahoo, but Microsoft also will have a ready-made Web front end for rolling out more of its desktop applications as services, said Paul Fox, CIO of Guy Carpenter, a New York-based reinsurance company.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;The Yahoo platform is really what they&#39;re buying,&quot; he said. &quot;With Yahoo, they&#39;re tapping into the base culture of the Internet online community that&#39;s matured over the last 10 years. It&#39;s going to make it easier for people to take a look at and try their services, whereas before it had to be a more conscious effort.&quot;</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Aside from the usual raft of consumer applications&#160;such as&#160;search, e-mail, maps, and the like, Microsoft already has brought some of its many business desktop applications -- such as Office and CRM -- online in hosted, though often scaled-down, versions.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Access to Yahoo&#39;s estimated 500 million visitors per month will give it a new channel to deliver what the company now calls its &quot;software plus services&quot; strategy, as well as buy the company time to bring more competitive versions of applications that were originally coded for the desktop to the Web.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Indeed, in the conference call discussing the Yahoo bid Friday, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer made a pointed reference to efforts to shed its desktop legacy and move even aspects of its Windows OS to the Web, a trend the company started with some features in the latest version, Windows Vista.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;The Windows user wants to be live, the Windows experience needs to increasingly embrace the Internet,&quot; he said. &quot;There will be a Windows Live, there will be an Office Live as we continue to bring out innovations in which Office transforms and is transformed by the Internet.&quot;</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Ballmer also likely had the rising popularity of Web-hosted productivity software, such as Google Apps, Zoho, and&#160;<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/09/17/Yahoo-to-buy-Zimbra_1.html">Yahoo&#39;s Zimbra</a>, in mind when considering how to Web-enable Microsoft&#39;s desktop software. So far, Microsoft&#39;s Office Live has been more of a way for small businesses to get up and running with a Web site and basic hosted business applications&#160;such as&#160;accounting and CRM; however, bringing a full productivity suite to the Web has been Microsoft&#39;s plan for some time.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Microsoft also can leverage its own strength among business customers to bundle and technically link applications so that customers buy an all-in-one package rather than individual products. For instance, Microsoft has created tight links between a new unified communications product, Office Communications Server, and its Office and SharePoint collaboration software so that customers must buy them all together to create comprehensive infrastructure. Microsoft can make similar attachments between online versions of its applications -- or just bundle them together in creative ways -- and market them to a broader audience.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;If Microsoft does something well, it&#39;s bundling products and services,&quot; said Ned May, director and lead analyst of marketing research firm Outsell. He joked that if Microsoft purchases Yahoo, there might come a day when you start up Windows and &quot;up pops Yahoo, and it takes you three days to remove that functionality.&quot;</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">&quot;Yahoo provides a platform in many regards -- an audience of 500 million people to which you can bundle products and new offerings,&quot; May said.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Doing quick math, May figured that at &quot;500 million a month for about $44 billion,&quot; it will cost Microsoft about $86 a head for acquiring each member of its new audience of Web users. &quot;Not a bad deal,&quot; he said.</p></div>	4	2008-02-02 01:53:03	\N

The offer represents a 62 percent premium over Yahoo&#39;s closing price on Thursday. In premarket trading, Yahoo shares skyrocketed. Shares closed at $28.38, up by $9.20, or 47.97 percent.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Though most analysts said the deal would not likely hurt Google in the short term, Google shares closed down by $48.40, at $515.90. Shares of Microsoft, which has never done a deal this size, were down by $2.15, closing at $30.45.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Considering Yahoo&#39;s likely earnings and share price increases without an acquisition, for the price Microsoft is willing to pay, the offer &quot;seems like a great deal,&quot; said Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney in a research note.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">The proposal capped off a heavy earnings-report week. Though sales for the fourth quarter generally were strong, key companies, including Google and high-flying virtualization technology vendor VMware, fell short of analyst expectations.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">In the current economic climate in the United States, where many analysts are predicting a recession, market watchers pounce on bad news.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody"><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/01/29/Yahoos-Q4-sales-up-profit-down_1.html">Yahoo&#39;s fourth-quarter revenue increased, but profit fell to $206 million</a>&#160;from $269 million one year earlier. During its financial conference call Wednesday, CEO Jerry Yang announced that the company would be laying off about 1,000 workers and talked about the U.S. economy hitting the company with &quot;headwinds.&quot;</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">Analysts worry that the company&#39;s Panama search engine ad system, rolled out last year, has not had the positive effect that was expected. They also note that the company is vague about expected investments and that it is appearing to lose further ground to Google in the search market.</p><p page="1" class="ArticleBody">In a research note, Citigroup Global Markets Equity Research downgraded its opinion on Yahoo from &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;hold.&quot; But after the Microsoft offer went public, Citigroup called the move &quot;a good fit to fix an ongoing issue.&quot;</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Though&#160;<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/01/31/Google-earnings-up-shy-of-expectations_1.html?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/01/31/Google-earnings-up-shy-of-expectations_1.html">Google on Thursday reported a 51 percent year-on-year revenue increase</a>&#160;to $4.83 billion for the quarter, earnings per share excluding certain items were $4.43, just below the $4.44 consensus analyst forecast. While most companies would be ecstatic to report such strong growth, the market had gotten used to Google continuing to blow past all expectations.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Many market watchers take Google&#39;s miss as a sign that the faltering economy is braking the search giant. If consumers cut back spending, Google may experience a slackening in consumers&#39; desire to click on advertising. The company&#39;s continuing reliance on search revenue is bothering investors. That issue may be worrying investors more than potential competition with a merged Microsoft-Yahoo.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">One bright note for the week in the Internet sector was Amazon&#39;s earnings announcement on Wednesday. Amazon revenue grew 42 percent, to $5.67 billion, as income more than doubled, to $207 million. While the company&#39;s forecast for operating margins was lower than expected, its revenue forecast was higher than expected -- welcome news in a climate of worry.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Then on Thursday,&#160;<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/01/31/Amazon-buys-Audible-for-300-million_1.html">Amazon announced it would buy Audible.com</a> , which sparked interest as the acquisition may help its battle against Apple in the market for spoken-word books, magazines, and radio programs. Amazon shares jumped by $3.49 to close at $77.70 Thursday, though they then drifted back down Friday.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">Outside the Internet arena, companies in a variety of sectors, including Lenovo, SAP, Verizon, and TSMC, reported strong fourth-quarter sales (though in SAP&#39;s case, profit was brought down by its acquisition of Business Objects). However, as usual in these times of economic uncertainty, it was&#160;<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/tech-bottom-line/archives/2008/01/ouch_vmware_dru.html">VMware&#39;s disappointing quarter and weak forecast</a> &#160;that captured the most attention.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">The company share price lost 34 percent of its value after VMware said Monday that revenue was $412.5 million, compared to analyst expectations of $417.4 million. Even though profit doubled, it was the revenue miss that had everyone nervous as hopes for the company were high after its red-hot IPO in December.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">&quot;The company&#39;s 2008 outlook suggests that low hanging fruit may have been picked and new customer signings could be slowing down,&quot; according to a UBS research note. This comment is probably right on the money. Most big-company CIOs consider server virtualization an obvious tactical move and have already implemented the technology.</p><p page="2" class="ArticleBody">By market close Friday, excitement over the Microsoft offer for Yahoo may have helped push the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index into positive territory. It closed at 2413.36, up by 23.50. As economic uncertainty rules, however, IT investors are bracing for a bumpy ride over the next few quarters.</p></div>	4	2008-02-02 03:33:02	\N

For the last couple of weeks I've been emailing with people from the LongNow Foundation and Martin Nisenholtz of the NY Times, to determine who won the bet. <br><br>\
Ultimately we asked the foundation to consider all the argument and make the decision.<br><br>\
They published their decision today. It's well worth reading because it answers some of the questions raised by the bet, for example, what is a blog, and how does Wikipedia relate to blogging. I don't agree with everything in the decision, but I do like the result -- we won. <img src="http://www.scripting.com/gifs/QBullets/qbullets/sidesmiley.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="smile"><br><br>\
The beneficiary of the bet? <a href="http://www.w3.org/">The World Wide Web Consortium</a>. I chose them as the charity to receive the proceeds if I won the bet because web standards are what make it all work and the W3C is central to standards on the web.<br><br>\

Scripting News	http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/02/01/bestFeelgoodPictureOf2007.html	Best feel-good picture of 2007	none	Software and Developement	Okay, a few days ago I wrote a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/01/26/everybodysDivingBell.html">review</a> of the Diving Bell and the Butterfly saying it could be the best picture of 2007, but even so you might want to skip it because the truth it reveals might be something you don't want to look at. It's a fine picture, but a tough one.<br><br>\
Another wonderful but tough picture is <a href="http://www.google.com/movies/reviews?cid=b8c422007696297f&fq=No+Country+for+Old+Men&sa=X&oi=showtimes&ct=reviews&cd=1">No Country for Old Men</a>. It's one of those movies that leaves so much unresolved that you walk out of the theater not sure which foot goes in front of the other. On a second viewing it makes much more sense. The world isn't necessarily as crazy as it at first seemed.<br><br>\
<a href="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/02/01/junoWithPipeInChair.jpg"><img src="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/02/01/juno.jpg" width="83" height="114" border="0" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="5" alt="A picture named juno.jpg"></a>But there's a movie that is also incredibly well crafted, and gets better every time you think about it -- <a href="http://www.google.com/movies/reviews?cid=be72a38733bef9bd&fq=Juno">Juno</a>. I didn't realize how much I liked it until I heard someone compare it to Little Miss Sunshine, a movie that I did not enjoy, unlike everyone else it seems. I <i>loved</i> Juno because it organizes its sweetness into love for one person, the star of the movie, Juno. But everyone, no matter how dorky or clueless (and some of the adults are <i>truly</i> dorky and clueless) shares the love. The movie has a wholeness, an unqualified goodness, you not only walk out of the theater in love with Juno and everyone else in the movie, but your heart is warmed for everyone, including yourself. It's <i>that</i> good. <br><br>\
All three remind how good movies can be.<br><br>\
And there were some not-too-bad movies at the end of 2007, for example, <a href="http://www.google.com/movies/reviews?cid=b961e568572dc490&fq=Atonement">Atonement</a>, which some didn't like, but I did. <a href="http://www.google.com/movies/reviews?cid=b341b9de30507f2f&fq=3:10+to+Yuma">3:10 to Yuma</a> is a well-crafted genre picture. <a href="http://www.google.com/movies/reviews?cid=bc70be450fa121fa&fq=Michael+Clayton">Michael Clayton</a> was a perfect showcase for the talents of George Clooney. Great acting and a simple story in <a href="http://www.google.com/movies/reviews?cid=b7d197d583f2ed1f&fq=The+Savages">The Savages</a>. <br><br>\
Which one was the best? I'd hate to have to choose!<br><br>\

The premiere followed an 8 p.m. show summarizing the series’s complicated back story (13.1 million).Fox and NBC ranked second and third on the night among adults 18 to 49. CBS was fourth in that demographic but managed to finish second in total viewers. And CNN’s broadcast of the debate between Senator Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton drew an average of 8.3 million viewers, the most ever for a primary debate on cable news.	5	2008-02-02 07:26:03	\N

InfoWorld news	http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/02/news-microsoft-yahoo-it_1.html	Microsoft's Yahoo bid is really about business apps	none	Sci/Tech	<div class="rxbodyfield"><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">At first blush, Microsoft's <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/01/Microsoft-offers-to-buy-Yahoo-for-44-billion_1.html" class="regularArticleU">proposed acquisition</a> of Yahoo for $46.6 billion is about growing its consumer advertising and portal business to better compete wit Google. And that's certainly part of the mix, but perhaps lost in the discussion is how such an acquisition could help Microsoft execute its software-plus-services strategy for delivering business apps over the Internet faster and better, said several analysts. That strategy could help Microsoft compete with Google's own business-apps initiative, they said.</p><p align="right"><a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /><img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=patch_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/></a></p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1"><b>[ Follow</b> <b><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&amp;V=95033" class="regularArticleU">InfoWorld's ongoing coverage</a> of Microsoft's offer to buy Yahoo ]</b></p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">"Yahoo has very efficient datacenters, as does Microsoft," noted Rob Koplowitz, a Forrester Research analyst. By combining their datacenters -- and, more important, their engineering talent -- Microsoft should be able to move faster and more efficiently on delivering business apps over the Internet, something that Microsoft has done at a fairly slow pace so far. "Yahoo's engineers can help," he noted, "And you know that there'll be engineers who are freed up" after the acquisition, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/video/News/Microsoft-Yahoo/Microsoft-Yahoo-analysis/video_2178.html" class="regularArticleU">should it go through</a>.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">"Although Google Applications have yet to make a real dent in the Microsoft Office giant, they do pose a long-term threat," said David Mitchell, a senior IT researcher at the consultancy Ovum. "As a defense against this position, Microsoft needs to accelerate its own move into online services. The online engineering capabilities that Yahoo has will undoubtedly offer Microsoft the potential to bring new services to market" and will help Microsoft stay competitive.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Koplowitz said he does not believe Microsoft is trying to buy specific technology from Yahoo to fill a hole needed to compete against Google's business offerings. Microsoft wants more talent and capacity to follow its existing strategy, he said. Google's approach is to offer pure Web-based apps, which he noted are more mature than Microsoft's Web-delivered apps. Microsoft's approach is to extend its 450 million Office desktop seats through additional software delivered via the Internet. The strategies have some overlap, but because they are different, Koplowitz expects Microsoft and Google to take different technology paths rather than try to copy each other.</p><p class="ArticleBody" page="1">Microsoft's acquisition of Yahoo would also bolster the company in another area where it has fallen behind Google: search, said Charlene Yi, a Forrester analyst. "Microsoft is interested in search because it provides a beachhead into businesses -- especially small and medium-sized ones that don't have a direct relationship with Microsoft," she said, as businesses typically buy Office software from retailers and resellers. Google is using search to forge those direct relationships and then offer business apps that compete with Microsoft's plans.</p></div>	4	2008-02-02 13:22:18	\N
